# Cross-Language Vulnerabilities

This repository is a collection of **common smart contract vulnerabilities** implemented in multiple languages.  
The goal is to make each vulnerability easy to understand, compare, and fix across ecosystems like **Solidity**, **Vyper**, and **Rust (Anchor)**.

---

## Purpose
- Learn vulnerabilities by studying minimal & reproducible examples.
- See how the same bug appears in different languages.
- Practice writing secure fixes (and applying patterns like CEI).
- Build a reference library you can expand as you grow as a security researcher.

---

## Structure
Each vulnerability has its own folder.
Inside, there are language-specific subfolders with:
- A **vulnerable** version  
- A **fixed** version  
- A short **README** explaining the bug and fix
